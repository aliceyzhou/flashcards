This folder contains all the files you need to run my flashcards app.

When the app is launched, you will see the flashcard screen.
You can single tap to get a random flashcard, double tap to reveal the answer, or swipe left/right to view other cards sequentially. Clicking the giant star will favorite/unfavorite the card.

The next tab is a table view with all the existing flashcards. You can rearrange, delete, and add new flashcards (although, you can't add a question that already exists!)
The app uses data persistence to store any edits you've made, and you can see the changes next time you launch the app.

Finally, there is a favorite tab showing all your favorite flashcards.

Have fun!
